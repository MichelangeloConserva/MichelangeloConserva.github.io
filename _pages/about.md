Hello, I am Michelangelo!

## Now

I am currently finishing my MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine learning ([CSML](http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk/)) at University College of London. As part of the [Statistical Machine Learning Group](https://sml-group.cc/#people), I am developing a new kernel for partially ranked data under the supervision of [Marc Deisenroth](https://deisenroth.cc) and [Sesh Kumar](https://seshkumar.github.io).


In September I will start my PhD in the [GameAI group](https://gaigresearch.github.io/) at Queen Mary University of London under the supervision of [Simon Lucas](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/lucassimon.html).
My work will be supported by a four-years scholarship granted by the [IGGI programme](http://iggi.org.uk/).


## Research interest

My goal is to develop algorithms to power causality driven AI systems.


## Free time

In my free time I enjoy playing grand strategy games like the one from Paradox and Total War series.
I also love cooking and reading interesting books, you can find a list of books I suggest [here]({{ base_path }}/books).
