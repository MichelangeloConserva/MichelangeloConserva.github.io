Hello, I am Michelangelo!

## Now

I am a PhD student [@GAIG_QMUL](https://gaigresearch.github.io/) under the supervision of [Simon Lucas](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/lucassimon.html) and [Paulo Rauber](http://paulorauber.com/).
My work is supported by a four-years scholarship granted by the [IGGI programme](http://iggi.org.uk/).

## Past

I obtained an MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine learning ([CSML](http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk/)) from University College of London where I joined the [Statistical Machine Learning Group](https://sml-group.cc/#people).
Together with [Marc Deisenroth](https://deisenroth.cc) and [Sesh Kumar](https://seshkumar.github.io), we developed a new kernel for ranked data.

I hold a BSc in Statistics, Economics and Finance cum laude from Sapienza University of Rome. For my BSc dissertation I worked with [Anna Conte](https://www.dss.uniroma1.it/it/dipartimento/persone/conte-anna) to investigating the connection between Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory.


## Research interest

My goal is to derive statistically efficient and flexible control algorithms.


## Free time

In my free time I enjoy playing grand strategy games like the one from Paradox and Total War series.
I also love cooking and reading interesting books.
